# podcast-player

This is a basic react-based podcast player. It currently works for the podcast [Puck Soup](https://www.pucksoup.com/). It utilises the [spreaker API](https://developers.spreaker.com/api/) to get episode information.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. A live deployment is available here - [https://quizzical-almeida-d7ab56.netlify.com/](https://quizzical-almeida-d7ab56.netlify.com/)

### Prerequisites

podcast-player has the following dependencies -

- `axios v0.18.0`
- `moment v2.22.2`;
- `react-player v1.6.6`;
- `react v16.6.1`;
- `react-dom v16.6.1`; and
- `react-scripts v2.1.1`.

Clone down this repo, navigate to the directory in your terminal emulator of choice and use `npm i` to install the dependencies.

After that, you can start up a local version of the app using `npm start`.

### Notes

You may need to disable your tracker blocker (like [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger/) or disconnect/ghostery/ublock origin etc) as this might affect the api call.
