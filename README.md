# podcast-player

This is a basic react-based podcast player. It currently works for the podcast [Puck Soup](https://www.pucksoup.com/). It utilises the [spreaker API](https://developers.spreaker.com/api/) to get episode information.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

podcast-player has the following dependencies -

- `axios v0.18.0`
- `moment v2.22.2`;
- `react-player v1.6.6`;
- `react v16.6.1`;
- `react-dom v16.6.1`; and
- `react-scripts v2.1.1`.

You can install these dependencies after cloning down the repo using `npm i` or installing them manually. After that, you can start it up using `npm start`.

### Notes

You may need to disable your tracker blocker (like [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger/) etc) as this might affect the api call.
